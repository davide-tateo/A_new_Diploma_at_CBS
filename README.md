# A_new_Diploma_at_CBS

This code was realised in team as part of an assignment for the Foundation of Data Science course at Copenhagen Business School.  
Other team members: Álvaro Díaz-Dávila Álvarez, Alexandros Kyriakopoulos, Francesca Salute 

## GENERAL PURPOSE OF THE CODE

Let us suppose university wants to introduce a new Diploma in Data Science, made of four courses.
The system's main objective is to manage all the information relative to courses and students in the diploma.

The course management has introduced 5 mandatory assignments in each course. The mandatory assignments from each course are graded as either Pass or Fail. To pass a course, a student has to pass at least 3 out of 5 mandatory assignments that course. In order to pass the whole diploma programme in Data Science successfully, a student needs to pass all the courses individually by meeting up the requirements of passing 3 out of 5 mandatory assignments in each course of the diploma programme. Additionally, a student can also get a diploma certificate with distinction if the student passes at least 17 mandatory assignments (out of a total of 20 assignments) from all the courses. Please note that this design choice chosen by course coordinators will make sure that a student who wants a distinction will have to pass all 5 mandatory assignments from at least one single course (and 4 out of 5 assignments for the remaining 3 courses) to qualify for the distinction.
